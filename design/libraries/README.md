Library Design Guidance
=======================

This directory contains some documentation of recommendations for
library authors who want to make IPLD libraries in a new language
(or, perhaps for readers who want to understand an existing library better).

Some of the information expressed here comes down to opinions moreso than specification;
what is good ergonomics may vary wildly per language, so take these as
recommendations rather than strictures.
